    <h2>What is Software Engineering?</h2>

    <p>
      Software engineering is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable
      approach to the design, development, maintenance, and management of
      software. It encompasses the use of engineering principles to create
      software that is reliable, efficient, maintainable, and scalable. Software
      engineering is not just about writing code; it's about solving complex
      problems, managing projects, and ensuring that software meets the needs of
      users and businesses.
